**dandik.systems** grew out of an idea of collaborative notebook, a place meant to be writing down thoughts and ideas - *even if they are dandik as hell* - before they vanish.

If you want to contribute a weird, rough, or a dandik idea, we’d love to have you here. We’re mostly into **mathematics** right now, but who says it has to stay that way? Don’t hesitate to reach out!


## Math Typesetting

You can use LaTeX math in your posts. For inline math, use single dollar signs, e.g. $F = ma$.

For display math, use double dollar signs:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$
