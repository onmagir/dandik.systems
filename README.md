# dandik.systems

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for [dandik.systems](https://dandik.systems/), a math-oriented group blog. We used [@ddritzenhoff](https://www.github.com/ddritzenhoff)'s slightly tinkered version of [ritzy](https://github.com/ddritzenhoff/ritzy) theme. Highly recommended!

- We are using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) for math typesetting, instead of MathJax.
- A dark color palette is used by default
