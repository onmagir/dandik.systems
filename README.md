# dandik.systems

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for dandik.systems, a math-oriented group blog. We used [@ddritzenhoff](https://www.github.com/ddritzenhoff)'s slightly tinkered version of [ritzy](https://github.com/ddritzenhoff/ritzy) theme, highly recommended!

- We are using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) for math typesetting, instead of MathJax.
- The default color palette is set to a dark theme
